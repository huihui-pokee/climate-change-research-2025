# Climate Change Research Findings 2025

Summary of recent climate change research findings:

**Global Temperature and Greenhouse Gas Levels:**

*   **Warmest Year on Record:** 2024 was confirmed as the warmest year on record, with a global average surface temperature of 1.55째C above the 1850-1900 average.
*   **Continued Warming:** It's likely that 2025 will be among the warmest years on record.
*   **Greenhouse Gas Surge:** Levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached a new record high. Carbon dioxide is accumulating faster than ever before, increasing by over 10% in just two decades.
*   **Carbon Emissions Increase:** Carbon emissions reached 41.6 billion tonnes, an increase from 40.6 billion tonnes the previous year, indicating that fossil fuel use remains unchecked.
*   **Ocean Warming:** The ocean is the warmest it has ever been, not only at the surface but also in the upper 2000 meters. The ocean stores about 90% of the excess heat from global warming, making ocean heat content a critical climate change indicator.

**Impacts of Climate Change:**

*   **Extreme Weather Events:** There has been an increase in extreme weather events, with 32 events in 2024 linked to climate change.
*   **Health Threats:** People in every country face record-breaking threats to health and survival from climate change.
*   **Melting Ice and Sea Level Rise:** Melting ice and glaciers and rising sea levels threaten socio-economic disruption.
*   **Uninhabitable Conditions:** Rising heat and humidity are pushing more people outside of habitable climatic conditions, with over 600 million already affected.
*   **Impact on Earth's Rotation:** The melting of polar ice is causing a slight wobble in the planet and lengthening the day.
*   **Marine Heatwaves:** Global warming has tripled the number of days per year that the oceans experience extreme surface heat conditions and is responsible for a 1째C increase in the maximum intensity of marine heatwave events.

**Focus on Methane:**

*   **Surging Methane Levels:** Methane levels have surged since 2006, driven primarily by human activities.
*   **Need for Methane Reductions:** Methane would need to be reduced by about a third to limit warming to around 1.5째C.

**Potential Tipping Points:**

*   **Amazon Resilience:** Biocultural diversity can bolster the Amazon's resilience against climate change.
*   **AMOC Stability:** The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings, suggesting that a collapse is unlikely in the 21st century.

**Other Findings:**

*   **Aerosol Reduction Paradox:** Regulations imposed on the shipping industry in 2020, which led to an 80% drop in sulphur dioxide emissions, have ironically sped up global warming and led to higher ocean temperatures.
*   **Climate Policies:** Ambitious and equitable climate policies are needed, and these policies need to be perceived as fair by the public to ensure their success.
*   **Heat-Related Deaths:** In many cities, annual heat-related deaths could exceed COVID-19 death rates within 10 years if global temperatures rise by 3.0 째C above pre-industrial levels.
